### 1.1 Starting SoniferQuqonBot with Docker-compose.

* Clone the project.<br>``git clone https://github.com/ilyarolf/SoniferQuqonBot.git``
* Set environment variables in .env file.
* Set your domain in the docker-compose.yml file to the bot service in the labels caddy section. {YOUR_IP_ADDRESS}.sslip.io
* Run the ``docker-compose up`` command.

#### Development and production mode

For local development on a computer which is not internet facing, set the "RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENT" to "dev". The bot will
be connected via an ngrok tunnel.
> **Note**
> **<br>To get the ngrok token, you need to register on the ngrok website and confirm your email. Then you will have the
ngrok token in your personal account.<br>You will still need Redis.**

On an internet facing production system you can either set your own hostname in the caddy label (in the template shown
with "YOUR_DOMAIN_GOES_HERE"
or make use of services
like [sslip.io](https://sslip.io/). [Caddy](https://hub.docker.com/r/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy) will automatically
pull a TLS certificate
and serves as reverse proxy for your bot. You can also run your bot together with an already existing reverse proxy. In
this case you have to remove the caddy service from the docker-compose file and configure the reverse proxy accordingly.

### 1.2 Starting SoniferQuqonBot without database encryption.

* Clone the project from the master branch. <br>``git clone https://github.com/ilyarolf/SoniferQuqonBot.git``
* Install all necessary packages <br>``pip install -r requirements.txt``
* Set the environment variables to run in the .env file.<br>Example:

```
WEBHOOK_PATH = "/"
WEBAPP_HOST = "localhost"
WEBAPP_PORT = 5000
TOKEN = "1234567890:QWER.....TYI"
ADMIN_ID_LIST = 123456,654321
SUPPORT_LINK = "https://t.me/your_username_123"
DB_NAME = "database.db"
DB_ENCRYPTION = "false"
DB_PASS = ""
NGROK_TOKEN = "NGROK_TOKEN_HERE"
PAGE_ENTRIES = "8"
BOT_LANGUAGE = "en"
MULTIBOT = "false"
CURRENCY = "USD"
RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENT = "DEV"
WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN = "1234567890"
KRYPTO_EXPRESS_API_KEY = "API_KEY_HERE"
KRYPTO_EXPRESS_API_URL = "https://kryptoexpress.pro/api"
KRYPTO_EXPRESS_API_SECRET = "1234567890"
REDIS_PASSWORD = "1234567890"
REDIS_HOST = "localhost"
```

* After these steps the bot is ready to run, launch the bot with command ```python run.py```

### 1.3 Starting SoniferQuqonBot with SQLCipher database encryption.

> **Note**
> **<br>To run SoniferQuqonBot with database encryption via SQLCipher, you need to use Linux kernel operating systems.**

* Clone the project.
  branch.<br>``git clone https://github.com/ilyarolf/SoniferQuqonBot.git``
* Install the SQLCipher package, for example in Ubuntu this can be done with the
  command <br>``sudo apt install sqlcipher``.
* Install all necessary packages <br>``pip install -r requirements.txt``
* Install SQLCipher python package <br>``pip install sqlcipher3``
* Set the environment variables to run in the .env file.<br>Example:

```
WEBHOOK_PATH = "/"
WEBAPP_HOST = "localhost"
WEBAPP_PORT = 5000
TOKEN = "1234567890:QWER.....TYI"
ADMIN_ID_LIST = 123456,654321
SUPPORT_LINK = "https://t.me/your_username_123"
DB_NAME = "database.db"
DB_ENCRYPTION = "true"
DB_PASS = "1234567890"
NGROK_TOKEN = "NGROK_TOKEN_HERE"
PAGE_ENTRIES = "8"
BOT_LANGUAGE = "en"
MULTIBOT = "false"
CURRENCY = "USD"
RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENT = "DEV"
WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN = "1234567890"
KRYPTO_EXPRESS_API_KEY = "API_KEY_HERE"
KRYPTO_EXPRESS_API_URL = "https://kryptoexpress.pro/api"
KRYPTO_EXPRESS_API_SECRET = "1234567890"
REDIS_PASSWORD = "1234567890"
REDIS_HOST = "localhost"
```

* After these steps the bot is ready to run, the entry point to run the bot is run.py <br>```python run.py```
